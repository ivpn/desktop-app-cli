# IVPN Command Line Interface (CLI)

**IVPN Command Line Interface** is an official CLI for IVPN software.  
It is a client for IVPN daemon ([ivpn-desktop-daemon](https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-daemon))   
Can be compiled for different platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux

IVPN CLI is distributed on the official site [https://www.ivpn.net](https://www.ivpn.net).

## Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements


#### Windows
  - [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/)
  - Git

#### macOS
  - [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/)
  - Git

#### Linux
  - [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/)
  - packages: [FPM](https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html), curl, rpm, libiw-dev
  - Git

### Compilation

#### Windows

  **Note!**
  IVPN Daemon must be installed appropriately on a target system.  
  We recommend using [IVPN Client UI](https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-ui2) project to build a Windows installer for IVPN software.  

```
git clone https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-cli.git
cd desktop-app-cli
References\Windows\build.bat <VERSION_X.X.X>
```

  Compiled binaries can be found at: `bin\x86_64\cli`  

#### macOS

  **Note!**
  IVPN Daemon must be installed appropriately on a target system.  
  We recommend using [IVPN Client UI](https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-ui2) project to build a macOS DMG package for IVPN software.  

```
git clone https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-cli.git
cd desktop-app-cli/
./References/macOS/build.sh -v <VERSION_X.X.X>
```

  Compiled binary can be found at: `References/macOS/_out_bin/`

#### Linux
Instructions to build Linux DEB and RPM packages of IVPN software ('base' package: daemon + CLI):  

```
git clone https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-daemon.git
git clone https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-cli.git
cd desktop-app-cli/References/Linux/
./build.sh -v <VERSION_X.X.X>
```

  Compiled packages can be found at `desktop-app-cli/References/Linux/_out_bin`  

  **Info**
  You may be interested also in [IVPN Client UI](https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app-ui2) project to build a 'UI' Linux redistributable packages of IVPN software.


##### Manual installation on Linux
Sometimes it is required to have the possibility to install IVPN binaries manually.  
It's easy to do it by following the rules described below.

The ivpn-service is checking the existing of some required files (all files can be found in the repository)
```
VirtualBox:/opt/ivpn/etc$ ls -l
total 52
-r-------- 1 root root  2358 May 25 16:50 ca.crt
-rwx------ 1 root root   113 May 25 16:50 client.down
-rwx------ 1 root root  1927 May 25 16:50 client.up
-rwx------ 1 root root  5224 May 25 16:50 firewall.sh
-rw------- 1 root root 21524 May 26 20:52 servers.json
-r-------- 1 root root   636 May 25 16:50 ta.key
```
1. Build the current project to get 'ivpn service' and 'ivpn cli' binaries.
2. Create folder `/opt/ivpn/etc`
3. Copy all required files (see above).  
    **Note!** Files owner and access rights are important!
4. Now you can start compiled service binary from the command line (just to check if it works).  
    **Note!** The service must be started under a privileged user!  
    **Info!** You can use the command line parameter `--logging` to enable logging for service.  
    4.1. Simply run compiled ivpn-cli binary to check if it successfully connects to the service (use separate terminal).
5. If everything works - you can configure your environment to start ivpn-service automatically with the system boot (we are using systemd for such purposes)

## Versioning

Project is using [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org) for creating release versions.

SemVer is a 3-component system in the format of `x.y.z` where:

`x` stands for a **major** version  
`y` stands for a **minor** version  
`z` stands for a **patch**

So we have: `Major.Minor.Patch`
